            <h3> Question-1: Differences of map,forEach,filter and find?</h3>
            <h4>Ans-1:</h4>
            <p> map:
                The map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on
                every
                element in the calling array.</p>
            <p>
                forEach:
                The forEach() method is an iterative method. It calls a provided callbackFn function once for each
                element in an array in ascending-index order.
            </p>
            <p>filter:
                The filter() method creates a shallow copy of a portion of a given array, filtered down to just the
                elements from the given array that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
            </p>
            <p>
                find:
                The find() method returns the first element in the provided array that satisfies the provided testing
                function.

            <h3> Question-2: Differences of local storage, session storage and cookies ?
            </h3>
            <h4>Ans-2:</h4>
            <p>
                Local-storages:
                It allows for larger amounts of data to be stored, but the data is not deleted when the browser is
                closed. Local storage is useful for storing data that the user will need to access later, such as
                offline data.
            </p>
            <p>Session-storage:
                It only stored for the current session. This means that the data will be deleted when the user closes
                the browser.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cookies:
                Cookies are the oldest and most well-known mechanism. They are simple to use and well supported by
                browsers. However, they are limited to 4KB of data and are often used to store data that is not
                sensitive, such as user preferences.

            <h3> Question-3: What is Event-loop ? and how does it work?
            </h3>
            <h4>Ans-3:</h4>
            <p>
                Event-loop:
                The event loop is the secret behind JavaScriptâ€™s asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on
                a
                single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading.
                <br>
                The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed. Whenever a
                function is finished, it is popped from the stack.
                <br>
                The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows the
                queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for
                execution.

        <h1>Quiz question</h1>
        <div>
            <h3>What does work quiz-timer-function?</h3>
            <h4>Ans:</h4>
            <p>
                quiz-timer-function count user answers time. User have 60 seconds to answer 6 questions.

            <p>
                When user gives answer this function take the answer and show selected option number on display. It take
                the user answers and match it with correct answer and give the user answer then the correct answer. and
                it gives 10 marks for each correct answer.
